            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>When a business needs to collect a payment, VerityPay automatically sends an SMS containing a secure payment link to the end user. However, the SMS is not personalized and does not contain the amount of the payment.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>The goal was to design a payment platform that simplifies consumer payouts while maintaining high security and operational efficiency. VerityPay aims to:</p>
            <ul>
              <p>Ensure that the user: </p>
              <li> Receives the payment request instantly</li>
              <li> Recognizes the message as legitimate</li>
              <li> Can access the payment flow with a single tap</li>
              </p>Previous problem: </p>
              <li> Users were unsure whether the SMS link was valid or secure</li>
              <li> Lack of trust in SMS-based payment requests</li>
              <li> Resulted in incomplete payments and manual follow-ups by businesses</li>
              <p>Expected outcome: </p>
              <li> Higher link open rates</li>
              <li> Reduced early drop-off due to uncertainty</li>

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>We designed an end-to-end SMS-based payment flow that provides users with a clear, secure, and frictionless way to complete payments without requiring an app download.</p>

                <p>The solution centers around sending a trusted, branded SMS payment link that leads to a mobile-responsive web experience. Upon opening the link, users are guided through a lightweight identity verification step to ensure security while maintaining ease of use.</p>

                 <p>Once verified, users are presented with a transparent payment summary that clearly displays who is requesting the payment, the total amount due, and the available payment methods. Instead of collecting sensitive financial information directly, the flow integrates with well-known third-party providers such as PayPal and Venmo, increasing user trust and reducing cognitive friction.</p>

                 <p>By clearly defining each step of the process and supporting users with explicit system states and feedback, the solution minimizes uncertainty, reduces failed payments, and enables businesses to confidently send payment requests at scale.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Delivering a safer, faster, and more easy payment flow</h2>
 
          <li> SMS as the primary entry point</li>
          <p> We used SMS as the main channel to meet users where they already are, reducing friction and eliminating the need for app downloads or account creation.</p> 
          
          <li>  Lightweight identity verification</li>
          <p> A single-step verification (e.g., date of birth) was implemented to balance security and usability, protecting sensitive payment access without overwhelming users.</p>
          
          <li> Mobile web over native app</li>
          <p> A responsive web experience ensured immediate access across devices and browsers, especially for first-time or one-off payments.</p>
          
          <li> Third-party payment providers</li>
          <p> Integrating PayPal and Venmo leveraged existing user trust and avoided asking users to enter sensitive financial information directly.</p>
          
          <li> Clear system states and feedback</li>
          <p> Success, error, and edge states were explicitly designed to reduce uncertainty and prevent users from getting stuck in the flow.</p>

          <p>To evaluate the effectiveness of the end-to-end SMS payment experience, unmoderated usability testing and payment flow simulations were conducted with 20 users completing one-off and recurring payments.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Designing for trust, not just efficiency</h2>
      

          <li> Trust matters more than speed in payments</li>
          <p> Users were willing to take an extra step if it increased their confidence in the legitimacy of the payment request.</p>
          
          <li> Small friction can be beneficial</li>
          <p> Identity verification, when clearly explained, reduced abandonment rather than increasing it.</p>
          
          <li> Clarity reduces support load</li>
          <p> Clear summaries and error messages significantly reduced confusion-driven drop-offs and manual follow-ups.</p>
          
          <li> Familiar tools drive completion</li>
          <p> Users completed payments more often when given options they already knew and trusted.</p>

                  <h3>High-fidelity wireframes</h3>
                  <h2>Delivering a trustworthy and frictionless SMS payment experience</h2>
                  <p>The high-fidelity designs translated validated wireframe concepts into a polished, production-ready experience that emphasizes trust, clarity, and completion at every step of the SMS payment flow. Visual hierarchy, spacing, and typography were refined to guide users naturally from link entry to payment confirmation without introducing cognitive overload.</p>

                  <p>At this stage, branding, microcopy, and feedback states were intentionally designed to reinforce legitimacy and reduce anxiety around mobile payments. Clear confirmation messages, recognizable payment provider handoffs, and consistent UI patterns ensured users always understood where they were in the process and what action was required next.</p>

                 <p>The final outcome is a cohesive, mobile-first payment experience that balances security and ease of use—helping users complete payments confidently while enabling businesses to collect payments efficiently at scale.</p>

          <h3>Learnings & Reflections</h3>
          <h2>
            Payment experiences requires trust, not just speed</h2>
            <h5>Trust is a primary UX requirement</h5>
            <p>
              Even small uncertainties around identity verification or payment confirmation can stop users from completing a transaction. Clear explanations, previews, and confirmation states were critical.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Security friction must feel intentional</h5>
            <p>
              Users accepted verification steps when they were clearly communicated and felt proportional to the risk, proving that the right kind of friction can increase confidence rather than reduce conversion.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Constraints improved focus</h5>
            <p>
              Working within technical, security, and compliance constraints helped prioritize essential interactions and avoid unnecessary complexity.
            </p>
            
            <h5>Early validation prevented costly rework</h5>
            <p>
              Testing concepts at low and mid fidelity surfaced critical trust and clarity issues early, protecting both development time and product integrity.
