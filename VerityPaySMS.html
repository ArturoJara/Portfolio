            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>When a business needs to collect a payment, VerityPay automatically sends an SMS containing a secure payment link to the end user. However, the SMS is not personalized and does not contain the amount of the payment.</p>
          </div>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>The goal was to design a payment platform that simplifies consumer payouts while maintaining high security and operational efficiency. VerityPay aims to:</p>
            <ul>
              <p>Ensure that the user: </p>
              <li> Receives the payment request instantly</li>
              <li> Recognizes the message as legitimate</li>
              <li> Can access the payment flow with a single tap</li>
              </p>Previous problem: </p>
              <li> Users were unsure whether the SMS link was valid or secure</li>
              <li> Lack of trust in SMS-based payment requests</li>
              <li> Resulted in incomplete payments and manual follow-ups by businesses</li>
              <p>Expected outcome: </p>
              <li> Higher link open rates</li>
              <li> Reduced early drop-off due to uncertainty</li>

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>We designed an end-to-end SMS-based payment flow that provides users with a clear, secure, and frictionless way to complete payments without requiring an app download.</p>

                <p>The solution centers around sending a trusted, branded SMS payment link that leads to a mobile-responsive web experience. Upon opening the link, users are guided through a lightweight identity verification step to ensure security while maintaining ease of use.</p>

                 <p>Once verified, users are presented with a transparent payment summary that clearly displays who is requesting the payment, the total amount due, and the available payment methods. Instead of collecting sensitive financial information directly, the flow integrates with well-known third-party providers such as PayPal and Venmo, increasing user trust and reducing cognitive friction.</p>

                 <p>By clearly defining each step of the process and supporting users with explicit system states and feedback, the solution minimizes uncertainty, reduces failed payments, and enables businesses to confidently send payment requests at scale.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Delivering a safer, faster, and more easy payment flow</h2>
 
          <li> SMS as the primary entry point</li>
          <p> We used SMS as the main channel to meet users where they already are, reducing friction and eliminating the need for app downloads or account creation.</p> 
          
          <li>  Lightweight identity verification</li>
          <p> A single-step verification (e.g., date of birth) was implemented to balance security and usability, protecting sensitive payment access without overwhelming users.</p>
          
          <li> Mobile web over native app</li>
          <p> A responsive web experience ensured immediate access across devices and browsers, especially for first-time or one-off payments.</p>
          
          <li> Third-party payment providers</li>
          <p> Integrating PayPal and Venmo leveraged existing user trust and avoided asking users to enter sensitive financial information directly.</p>
          
          <li> Clear system states and feedback</li>
          <p> Success, error, and edge states were explicitly designed to reduce uncertainty and prevent users from getting stuck in the flow.</p>

          <h2 class="text-center">Designing for trust, not just efficiency</h2>
      

          <li> Trust matters more than speed in payments</li>
          <p> Users were willing to take an extra step if it increased their confidence in the legitimacy of the payment request.</p>
          
          <li> Small friction can be beneficial</li>
          <p> Identity verification, when clearly explained, reduced abandonment rather than increasing it.</p>
          
          <li> Clarity reduces support load</li>
          <p> Clear summaries and error messages significantly reduced confusion-driven drop-offs and manual follow-ups.</p>
          
          <li> Familiar tools drive completion</li>
          <p> Users completed payments more often when given options they already knew and trusted.</p>

            <h2>Understanding the Payment Automation Experience</h2>
            <p>To deeply understand how businesses and payees interact with VerityPay’s SMS Automation, I created an empathy map capturing what users say, think, do, and feel throughout the payment flow. This exercise helped surface key pain points around trust, clarity, and confirmation, while also revealing strong motivations for speed, simplicity, and reliability—directly informing how SMS automation was designed and prioritized in the platform.</p>

                                                <p>After identifying key friction points in the SMS automation experience through user research and refining the MVP scope using the MoSCoW matrix, I moved into outlining the core user interactions through task flows.</p>
                          
                                                <p>These task flows were designed and prioritized based on their ability to support the primary persona’s goals—creating reliable SMS templates, reducing messaging errors, ensuring Pilvo compliance, and enabling fast, confident payment communication at scale.</p>

                                                <p>The example shown illustrates one of these essential task flows: how an admin creates, previews, and activates an SMS payment template. This flow helped define the necessary screens, validations, and system logic—serving as a blueprint for the design phase and reinforcing VerityPay’s vision of a secure, low-friction, automation-first payment platform.</p>

                    <p>Transitioning from low- to mid-fidelity wireframes allowed me to shape the foundational layout of VerityPay’s SMS Template experience and evaluate how well each interaction supported real operational needs. This phase focused on organizing content clearly, validating critical user actions, and ensuring the workflow remained efficient, compliant, and scalable.</p>
                    <p>Working at this level of fidelity made it possible to uncover usability issues early, adjust navigation patterns, and align the interface with both user expectations and Pilvo’s technical requirements—before investing in visual polish.</p>

                  <h3>High-fidelity wireframes</h3>
                  <h2>Refining the SMS template experience for confidence and scale</h2>
                  <p>Moving into high-fidelity wireframes allowed me to translate validated structures and workflows into a polished, production-ready interface. At this stage, the focus shifted toward visual clarity, hierarchy, and feedback—ensuring that every interaction felt intentional, trustworthy, and easy to understand.</p>

                  <p>Design decisions at this level emphasized readability, status visibility, and error prevention, while reinforcing Pilvo compliance through subtle UI cues such as inline validations, character limits, and delivery-ready indicators. The result was an interface that balanced flexibility with control, enabling users to confidently manage SMS templates at scale.</p>

          <h3>Learnings & Reflections</h3>
          <h2>Designing automation requires trust, not just efficiency</h2>
          <p>This project reinforced that designing for automation—especially in financial contexts—goes beyond speed and functionality. Users need clarity, predictability, and reassurance at every step.</p>
          <li>
          Confidence is a core UX requirement
          Even small uncertainties in message content or delivery timing create hesitation. Explicit states, previews, and confirmations proved just as important as automation itself.
          </li>
          <li>
          Constraints sharpen design decisions
          Working within Pilvo’s technical and compliance limitations helped focus the experience on what truly mattered, eliminating unnecessary flexibility that could increase risk.
          </li>
          <li>
          Standardization enables scale
          Reusable patterns and consistent structures reduced errors while allowing the system to grow without adding cognitive or operational complexity.
          </li>
          <li>
          Early validation saves future rework
          Low- and mid-fidelity testing surfaced critical issues before visual refinement, protecting both development time and product integrity.
