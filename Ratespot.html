            <h2>Data-driven price feed redesigned for clarity, focus, and long-term use</h2>
            <p>RateSpot Price Feed is a real-time FinTech data platform used by professionals who analyze mortgage rates and market trends daily. The section was redesigned from the ground up to address poor action hierarchy and high cognitive load caused by dense financial data.</p>
            <p>By restructuring the layout and introducing a dark-first design optimized for long reading sessions, the experience improves scanability, reduces visual fatigue, and encourages deeper, longer interaction with the product—while maintaining the accuracy and depth required for financial decision-making.</p>

            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <h2>Lack of visibility in a critical, high-risk workflow</h2>
            <p>RateSpot Price Feed is a real-time financial data section used by professionals to monitor, compare, and analyze mortgage rates continuously. However, the previous experience did not provide a clear hierarchy between primary and secondary actions, making it difficult for users to quickly understand where to focus or how to interact with the data.</p>

            <p>The interface presented large volumes of real-time information without sufficient visual structure, increasing cognitive load and making extended analysis sessions mentally taxing. Key insights were not easily scannable, and the lack of a reading-optimized environment limited users’ ability to stay focused for long periods of time.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Improving clarity, focus, and engagement in data-heavy workflows</p>
            <p>The goal of the redesign was to create a more intentional and readable data visualization experience tailored for continuous use. The project aimed to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Establish a clear hierarchy of actions, differentiating primary analysis tasks from secondary controls..</li>
              <li>Improve scanability and readability of real-time financial data.</li>
              <li>Reduce cognitive load during long data-review sessions.</li>
              <li>Optimize the interface for prolonged usage through a dark-first design approach.</li>
              <li>Encourage deeper engagement with the Price Feed without compromising data density or accuracy.</li>

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <h2>A dark-first, structured data experience built for real-time analysis</h2>
                <p>The RateSpot Price Feed was redesigned as a focused, data-first experience that prioritizes clarity, hierarchy, and long-term usability. Instead of reducing information density, the solution restructures how data and actions are presented, allowing users to analyze real-time rates with less cognitive effort and greater confidence.</p>

            <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
            <h2>Learning from established data-heavy financial platforms</h2>
            <p>A competitive analysis was performed across financial and analytics platforms that handle real-time, high-volume data. The goal was not to replicate features, but to understand how mature products structure complex information, manage contrast, and support prolonged analytical workflows.</p>
            <p>This analysis surfaced consistent patterns such as dark-first interfaces, clear separation between data and controls, and the use of color as a semantic tool rather than decoration. These insights validated the decision to redesign the Price Feed as a focused, data-first experience optimized for long sessions.</p>
            <img src="images/projects/RateSpotCompetitiveAnalysis.png" alt="">
            <h4>Key Takeaways from the Comparison</h4>
            <p>This analysis revealed a clear gap in the market between professional-grade financial tools and consumer-friendly rate platforms. Bloomberg excels at handling extreme data density but sacrifices accessibility, while consumer tools prioritize simplicity at the cost of analytical depth.</p>
            <p>The redesign of RateSpot Price Feed was positioned to bridge this gap—retaining professional-level data depth while significantly improving hierarchy, readability, and long-session usability.</p>

            <h3>User Interviews</h3>
            <h2>What the data revealed</h2>
            <p>Through focused user research — including interviews with 10 Payors and 20 Payees — we gathered qualitative and quantitative insights into how SMS-based payments are created, approved, and delivered in VerityPay. While both roles interact with SMS payments, the research prioritized Payors, who are responsible for configuring and managing SMS templates at scale.</p>

            <p>The findings revealed key patterns around approval visibility, confidence in message compliance, and readiness for mass delivery. Payors expressed a strong need for clear template status, predictable approval timelines, and assurance that approved messages would be reliably delivered through the SMS provider. These insights directly informed improvements to the SMS Payments and Template Approval system, reinforcing transparency, reducing operational uncertainty, and enabling Payors to confidently trigger large-scale payment communications.</p>

                    <h2>Establishing structure and usability for SMS templates</h2>
                    <p>Transitioning from low- to mid-fidelity wireframes allowed me to shape the foundational layout of VerityPay’s SMS Template experience and evaluate how well each interaction supported real operational needs. This phase focused on organizing content clearly, validating critical user actions, and ensuring the workflow remained efficient, compliant, and scalable.</p>
                    <p>Working at this level of fidelity made it possible to uncover usability issues early, adjust navigation patterns, and align the interface with both user expectations and Pilvo’s technical requirements—before investing in visual polish.</p>

                  <h3>High-fidelity wireframes</h3>
                  <h2>Refining the SMS template experience for confidence and scale</h2>
                  <p>Moving into high-fidelity wireframes allowed me to translate validated structures and workflows into a polished, production-ready interface. At this stage, the focus shifted toward visual clarity, hierarchy, and feedback—ensuring that every interaction felt intentional, trustworthy, and easy to understand.</p>

                  <p>Design decisions at this level emphasized readability, status visibility, and error prevention, while reinforcing Pilvo compliance through subtle UI cues such as inline validations, character limits, and delivery-ready indicators. The result was an interface that balanced flexibility with control, enabling users to confidently manage SMS templates at scale.</p>

                  <p>Key Design Considerations

                    <li>
                      Clear visual hierarchy to prioritize message content and critical actions

                      Strong affordances for template states (draft, active, disabled)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Inline feedback and validation to prevent errors before sending</li>

            Clear structure, predictable layouts, and focused actions helped users understand the system faster and reduce hesitation when creating or activating templates.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Higher confidence in message delivery</h5>
          <p>
            Template previews, validation states, and visible status indicators reinforced trust, minimizing the fear of sending incorrect or non-compliant messages.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Faster template creation and management</h5>
          <p>
            Streamlined flows enabled users to create, edit, and deploy SMS templates with fewer steps, supporting high-volume payment operations without added complexity.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Improved consistency across communications</h5>

          <h3>Learnings & Reflections</h3>
          <h2>Designing automation requires trust, not just efficiency</h2>
          <h5>
            This project reinforced that designing for automation—especially in financial contexts—goes beyond speed and functionality. Users need clarity, predictability, and reassurance at every step.
          </h5>
          
          <h5>Confidence is a core UX requirement</h5>
          <p>
            Even small uncertainties in message content or delivery timing create hesitation. Explicit states, previews, and confirmations proved just as important as automation itself.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Constraints sharpen design decisions</h5>
          <p>
            Working within Pilvo’s technical and compliance limitations helped focus the experience on what truly mattered, eliminating unnecessary flexibility that could increase risk.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Standardization enables scale</h5>
          <p>
            Reusable patterns and consistent structures reduced errors while allowing the system to grow without adding cognitive or operational complexity.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Early validation saves future rework</h5>
          <p>
            Low- and mid-fidelity testing surfaced critical issues before visual refinement, protecting both development time and product integrity.

          <h3>Next Steps</h3>
          <h2>Expanding the system while preserving simplicity</h2>
          <h5>Template performance insights</h5>
          <p>
            Add analytics to show delivery success, timing effectiveness, and usage trends per template.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Advanced automation logic</h5>
          <p>
            Enable conditional rules (e.g., resend on failure, time-based triggers) while maintaining clear safeguards.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Role-based controls</h5>
          <p>
            Introduce permissions to ensure sensitive templates can only be edited or activated by authorized users.
          </p>
          
          <h5>Guided onboarding for first-time users</h5>
          <p>
            Contextual guidance and best-practice examples could further reduce ramp-up time and prevent early mistakes.
